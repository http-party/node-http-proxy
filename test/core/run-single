// Basic idea behind core test runner is to modify core tests as little as
// possible. That's why we start up node-http-proxy here instead of embeeding
// this code in tests.
//
// In most cases only modification to core tests you'll need is changing port
// of http client to common.PROXY_PORT.
//

if (!test) {
  return console.error('Need test to run');

proxy.listen(common.PROXY_PORT);
